# LACare GitHub Instructions

**This file contains instruction on how to use GitHub for version control of LA Care code developed in the Cloudera DSW.**

### Creating a new GitHub account for LA Care work
It is important that each LA Care data scientist has a private GitHub account reserved only for code developed at LA Care. When creating the new account, the username should be in the following format: *lacare-<firstinitial,lastname>* (e.g., lacare-bshelton).

Once a new account is created, alert Brandon Shelton via email (bshelton@lcare.org) and the new account will be added to the **LACare-DataScience** private organization.
