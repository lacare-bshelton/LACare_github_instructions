# LACare_github_instructions

##### This file contains instruction on how to use GitHub for version control of LA Care code developed in the Cloudera DSW.

### Creating a new GitHub account for LA Care work
It is important that each LA Care data scientist has a private GitHub account reserved only for code developed at LA Care. When creating the new account, the username should be in the following format: *lacare-<firstinitial,lastname>* (e.g., lacare-bshelton).

Once a new account is created, it should be converted to a plan with private repositories by:
+ Click the dropdown icon in the top right corner of GitHub webpage
+ Click on *Settings*
+ When the new webpage opens, select *Billing* from the options on the left hand side of the page
+ Under *Plan*, click on *Get private repositories*
+ Enter your own credit card information to pay for a full year
+ Expense the payment via your LA Care [Concur Solutions](https://www.concursolutions.com) account
